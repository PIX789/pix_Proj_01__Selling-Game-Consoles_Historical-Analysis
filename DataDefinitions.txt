Data Definitions and Considerations: 

A]
Raw Data Columns/Cell/Row Mappings: 
Col A : Console Name
Col B : Type
Col C : Company
Col D : Released Year
Col E : Discontinuation Year
Col F : Units sold (million)
Col G : Remarks


B]
Let us not consider the column "Remarks" let us assume the values of the column "Units sold (million)"  as the final values.

C]
Col G : Current_Year
Considered Current_Year is 2023

D]
Col H : Duration_Year:
1. If "Released Year" < "Discontinuation Year" than we will simply show the difference in terms of duration
2. If "Released Year" = "Discontinuation Year" than we will consider as 1 year in terms of duration
3. If "Released Year" > "Discontinuation Year" than we will exchange the values and than consider the difference in terms of duration
4. If "Discontinuation Year" is Zero (0), than we will consider it as non-discontinued and consider current year to get the difference in terms of duration
Here we have to consider further conditions as
4.1 If "Released Year" is same as "Current Year" Zero (0), than we will consider as 1 year in terms of duration
4.2 If "Released Year" < "Current Year" than we will simply show the difference in terms of duration

Final Formula:
=IF((E2=0),(IFS((D2=H2),(1),(D2<H2),(H2-D2))),(IFS((E2>D2),(E2-D2),(E2<D2),(D2-E2),(E2=D2),(1))))


Formula Splitup:
=IF(
    (E2=0),(IFS(
	            (D2=H2),(1),
				(D2<H2),(H2-D2)
				)),
	(IFS(
	     (E2>D2),(E2-D2),
		 (E2<D2),(D2-E2),
		 (E2=D2),(1)
		 )
     )
   )



E]
Col I : Yearly_Avg_Units_Sold_Rounded_Millions:
This values says average yearly units sold in millions rounded to 2 decimat points

Final Formula:
=ROUND((F2/H2),2)
